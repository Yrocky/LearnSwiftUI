/// A structure that computes views and disclosure groups on demand from an
/// underlying collection of tree-structured, identified data.
///
/// Use an outline group when you need a view that can represent a hierarchy
/// of data by using disclosure views. This allows the user to navigate the
/// tree structure by using the disclosure views to expand and collapse
/// branches.
///
/// In the following example, a tree structure of `FileItem` data offers a
/// simplified view of a file system. Passing the root of this tree and the
/// key path of its children allows you to quickly create a visual
/// representation of the file system.
///
///     struct FileItem: Hashable, Identifiable, CustomStringConvertible {
///         var id: Self { self }
///         var name: String
///         var children: [FileItem]? = nil
///         var description: String {
///             switch children {
///             case nil:
///                 return "üìÑ \(name)"
///             case .some(let children):
///                 return children.isEmpty ? "üìÇ \(name)" : "üìÅ \(name)"
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
///     let data =
///       FileItem(name: "users", children:
///         [FileItem(name: "user1234", children:
///           [FileItem(name: "Photos", children:
///             [FileItem(name: "photo001.jpg"),
///              FileItem(name: "photo002.jpg")]),
///            FileItem(name: "Movies", children:
///              [FileItem(name: "movie001.mp4")]),
///               FileItem(name: "Documents", children: [])
///           ]),
///          FileItem(name: "newuser", children:
///            [FileItem(name: "Documents", children: [])
///            ])
///         ])
///
///     OutlineGroup(data, children: \.children) { item in
///         Text("\(item.description)")
///     }
///
/// ### Type Parameters
///
/// Five generic type constraints define a specific `OutlineGroup` instance:
///
/// - `Data`: The type of a collection containing the children of an element in
///   the tree-shaped data.
/// - `ID`: The type of the identifier for an element.
/// - `Parent`: The type of the visual representation of an element whose
///   children property is non-`nil`
/// - `Leaf`: The type of the visual representation of an element whose
///   children property is `nil`.
/// - `Subgroup`: A type of a view that groups a parent view and a view
///   representing its children, typically with some mechanism for showing and
///   hiding the children
