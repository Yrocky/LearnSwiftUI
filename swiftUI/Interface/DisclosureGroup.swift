/// A view that shows or hides another content view, based on the state of a
/// disclosure control.
///
/// A disclosure group view consists of a label to identify the contents, and a
/// control to show and hide the contents. Showing the contents puts the
/// disclosure group into the "expanded" state, and hiding them makes the
/// disclosure group "collapsed".
///
/// In the following example, a disclosure group contains two toggles and
/// an embedded disclosure group. The top level disclosure group exposes its
/// expanded state with the bound property, `topLevelExpanded`. By expanding
/// the disclosure group, the user can use the toggles to update the state of
/// the `toggleStates` structure.
///
///     struct ToggleStates {
///         var oneIsOn: Bool = false
///         var twoIsOn: Bool = true
///     }
///     @State private var toggleStates = ToggleStates()
///     @State private var topExpanded: Bool = true
///
///     var body: some View {
///         DisclosureGroup("Items", isExpanded: $topExpanded) {
///             Toggle("Toggle 1", isOn: $toggleStates.oneIsOn)
///             Toggle("Toggle 2", isOn: $toggleStates.twoIsOn)
///             DisclosureGroup("Sub-items") {
///                 Text("Sub-item 1")
///             }
///         }
