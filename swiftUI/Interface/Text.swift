import Foundation


/// A view that displays one or more lines of read-only text.
///
/// A text view draws a string in your app's user interface using a
/// ``Font/body`` font that's appropriate for the current platform. You can
/// choose a different standard font, like ``Font/title`` or ``Font/caption``,
/// using the ``View/font(_:)`` view modifier.
///
///     Text("Hamlet")
///         .font(.title)
///
/// ![A text view showing the name "Hamlet" in a title
/// font.](SwiftUI-Text-title.png)
///
/// If you need finer control over the styling of the text, you can use the same
/// modifier to configure a system font or choose a custom font. You can also
/// apply view modifiers like ``Text/bold()`` or ``Text/italic()`` to further
/// adjust the formatting.
///
///     Text("by William Shakespeare")
///         .font(.system(size: 12, weight: .light, design: .serif))
///         .italic()
///
/// ![A text view showing by William Shakespeare in a 12 point, light, italic,
/// serif font.](SwiftUI-Text-font.png)
///
/// A text view always uses exactly the amount of space it needs to display its
/// rendered contents, but you can affect the view's layout. For example, you
/// can use the ``View/frame(width:height:alignment:)`` modifier to propose
/// specific dimensions to the view. If the view accepts the proposal but the
/// text doesn't fit into the available space, the view uses a combination of
/// wrapping, tightening, scaling, and truncation to make it fit. With a width
/// of `100` points but no constraint on the height, a text view might wrap a
/// long string:
///
///     Text("To be, or not to be, that is the question:")
///         .frame(width: 100)
///
/// ![A text view showing a quote from Hamlet split over three
/// lines.](SwiftUI-Text-split.png)
///
/// Use modifiers like ``View/lineLimit(_:)``, ``View/allowsTightening(_:)``,
/// ``View/minimumScaleFactor(_:)``, and ``View/truncationMode(_:)`` to
/// configure how the view handles space constraints. For example, combining a
/// fixed width and a line limit of `1` results in truncation for text that
/// doesn't fit in that space:
///
///     Text("Brevity is the soul of wit.")
///         .frame(width: 100)
///         .lineLimit(1)
///
/// ![A text view showing a truncated quote from Hamlet starting Brevity is t
/// and ending with three dots.](SwiftUI-Text-truncated.png)
///
/// ### Localizing Strings
///
/// If you initialize a text view with a string literal, the view uses the
/// ``Text/init(_:tableName:bundle:comment:)`` initializer, which interprets the
/// string as a localization key and searches for the key in the table you
/// specify, or in the default table if you don't specify one.
///
///     Text("pencil") // Searches the default table in the main bundle.
///
/// For an app localized in both English and Spanish, the above view displays
/// "pencil" and "lápiz" for English and Spanish users, respectively. If the
/// view can't perform localization, it displays the key instead. For example,
/// if the same app lacks Danish localization, the view displays "pencil" for
/// users in that locale. Similarly, an app that lacks any localization
/// information displays "pencil" in any locale.
///
/// To explicitly bypass localization for a string literal, use the
/// ``Text/init(verbatim:)`` initializer.
///
///     Text(verbatim: "pencil") // Displays the string "pencil" in any locale.
///
/// If you intialize a text view with a variable value, the view uses the
/// ``Text/init(_:)-9d1g4`` initializer, which doesn't localize the string. However,
/// you can request localization by creating a ``LocalizedStringKey`` instance
/// first, which triggers the ``Text/init(_:tableName:bundle:comment:)``
/// initializer instead:
///
///     // Don't localize a string variable...
///     Text(writingImplement)
///
///     // ...unless you explicitly convert it to a localized string key.
///     Text(LocalizedStringKey(writingImplement))
///
/// When localizing a string variable, you can use the default table by omitting
/// the optional initialization parameters — as in the above example — just like
/// you might for a string literal.
