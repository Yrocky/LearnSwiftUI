/// A property wrapper type that can read and write a value managed by SwiftUI.
///
/// SwiftUI manages the storage of any property you declare as a state. When the
/// state value changes, the view invalidates its appearance and recomputes the
/// body. Use the state as the single source of truth for a given view.
///
/// A ``State`` instance isn't the value itself; it's a means of reading and
/// writing the value. To access a state's underlying value, use its variable
/// name, which returns the ``State/wrappedValue`` property value.
///
/// You should only access a state property from inside the view's body, or from
/// methods called by it. For this reason, declare your state properties as
/// private, to prevent clients of your view from accessing them. It is safe to
/// mutate state properties from any thread.
///
/// To pass a state property to another view in the view hierarchy, use the
/// variable name with the `$` prefix operator. This retrieves a binding of the
/// state property from its ``State/projectedValue`` property. For example, in
/// the following code example `PlayerView` passes its state property
/// `isPlaying` to `PlayButton` using `$isPlaying`:
///
///     struct PlayerView: View {
///         var episode: Episode
///         @State private var isPlaying: Bool = false
///
///         var body: some View {
///             VStack {
///                 Text(episode.title)
///                 Text(episode.showTitle)
///                 PlayButton(isPlaying: $isPlaying)
///             }
///         }
///     }

///
///     @StateObject var model = DataModel()
///

/// on those properties:
///
///     Text(model.title) // Updates the view any time `title` changes.
///
/// You can pass the state object into a property that has the

/// to the Environment of a view hierarchy by applying the
/// ``SwiftUI/View/environmentObject(_:)`` modifier:

///         .environmentObject(model)

///
/// Get a ``SwiftUI/Binding`` to one of the state object's properties using the

/// one of the object's properties. For example, you can let a
/// ``SwiftUI/Toggle`` control a Boolean value called `isEnabled` stored in the
/// model:
///
///     Toggle("Enabled", isOn: $model.isEnabled)
