/// A property wrapper that reads a value from a view's environment.
///
/// Use the `Environment` property wrapper to read a value
/// stored in a view's environment. Indicate the value to read using an
/// ``EnvironmentValues`` key path in the property declaration. For example, you
/// can create a property that reads the color scheme of the current
/// view using the key path of the ``EnvironmentValues/colorScheme``
/// property:
///
///     @Environment(\.colorScheme) var colorScheme: ColorScheme
///
/// You can condition a view's content on the associated value, which
/// you read from the declared property's ``wrappedValue``. As with any property
/// wrapper, you access the wrapped value by directly referring to the property:
///
///     if colorScheme == .dark { // Checks the wrapped value.
///         DarkContent()
///     } else {
///         LightContent()
///     }
///
/// If the value changes, SwiftUI updates any parts of your view that depend on
/// the value. For example, that might happen in the above example if the user
/// changes the Appearance settings.
///
/// You can use this property wrapper to read --- but not set --- an environment
/// value. SwiftUI updates some environment values automatically based on system
/// settings and provides reasonable defaults for others. You can override some
/// of these, as well as set custom environment values that you define,
/// using the ``View/environment(_:_:)`` view modifier.
///
/// For the complete list of environment values provided by SwiftUI, see the
/// properties of the ``EnvironmentValues`` structure. For information about
/// creating custom environment values, see the ``EnvironmentKey`` protocol.

///         }

///
///     MyView()
///         .environment(\.myCustomValue, "Another string")

/// A collection of environment values propagated through a view hierarchy.

/// SwiftUI exposes a collection of values to your app's views in an

/// declare a property using the ``Environment`` property wrapper and
/// specify the value's key path. For example, you can read the current locale:
///
///     @Environment(\.locale) var locale: Locale
///
/// Use the property you declare to dynamically control a view's layout.
/// SwiftUI automatically sets or updates many environment values, like
/// ``EnvironmentValues/pixelLength``, ``EnvironmentValues/scenePhase``, or
/// ``EnvironmentValues/locale``, based on device characteristics, system state,
/// or user settings. For others, like ``EnvironmentValues/lineLimit``, SwiftUI
/// provides a reasonable default value.
///
/// You can set or override some values using the ``View/environment(_:_:)``
/// view modifier:
///
///     MyView()
///         .environment(\.lineLimit, 2)
///
/// The value that you set affects the environment for the view that you modify
/// --- including its descendants in the view hierarchy --- but only up to the
/// point where you apply a different environment modifier.
///
/// SwiftUI provides dedicated view modifiers for setting some values, which
/// typically makes your code easier to read. For example, rather than setting
/// the ``EnvironmentValues/lineLimit`` value directly, as in the previous
/// example, you should instead use the ``View/lineLimit(_:)`` modifier:
///
///     MyView()
///         .lineLimit(2)
///
/// In some cases, using a dedicated view modifier provides additional
/// functionality. For example, you must use the
/// ``View/preferredColorScheme(_:)`` modifier rather than setting
/// ``EnvironmentValues/colorScheme`` directly to ensure that the new
/// value propagates up to the presenting container when presenting a view
/// like a popover:
///
///     MyView()
///         .popover(isPresented: $isPopped) {
///             PopoverContent()
///                 .preferredColorScheme(.dark)

///

/// conforms to the ``EnvironmentKey`` protocol, and then extending the
/// environment values structure with a new property. Use your key to get and

///
///     private struct MyEnvironmentKey: EnvironmentKey {
