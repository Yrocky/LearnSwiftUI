/// Provides functionality for opening a URL.
///
/// The `OpenURLAction` instance in the app's ``Environment`` offers
/// a handler that you can use to open a URL in response to some action.
/// Use the ``EnvironmentValues/openURL`` environment value to get the handler.
/// Then call the action's handler when you need to open a URL. For example,
/// you can open a support URL in response to when a user taps a button:
///
///     struct OpenUrlActionView: View {
///         @Environment(\.openURL) var openURL
///
///         var body: some View {
///             Button(action: contactSupport) {
///                 Text("Email Support")
///                 Image(systemName: "envelope.open")
///             }
///         }
///
///         func contactSupport() {
///             guard let url = URL(string: "https://www.example.com") else {
///                 return
///             }
///             openURL(url)
///         }
///     }

    ///     the URL can be opened.
